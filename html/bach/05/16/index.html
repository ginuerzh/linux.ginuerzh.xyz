<p>The <em>unlink</em> system call removes a directory entry for a file. The syntax for the <em>unlink</em> call is</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">unlink(pathname);
</code></pre>

<p>where <em>pathname</em> identifies the name of the file to be <em>unlinked</em> from the directory hierarchy. If a process <em>unlinks</em> a given file, no file is accessible by that name until another directory entry with that name is created. In the following code fragment, for example,</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">unlink(&quot;myfile&quot;);
fd = open(&quot;myfile&quot;, O_RDONLY);
</code></pre>

<p>the <em>open</em> call should fail, because the current directory no longer contains a file called <em>myfile</em>. If the file being <em>unlinked</em> is the last link of the file, the kernel eventually frees its data blocks. However, if the file had several links, it is still accessible by its other names.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">algorithm unlink
input:  file name
output: none
{
    get parent inode of file to be unlinked (algorithm namei);
    /* if unlinking the current directory ... */
    if (last component of file name is &quot;.&quot;)
        increment inode reference count;
    else
        get inode of file to be unlinked (algorithm iget);
    if (file is directory but user is not super user)
    {
        release inodes (algorithm iput);
        return(error);
    }
    if (shared text file and link count currently 1)
        remove from region table;
    write parent directory: zero inode number of unlinked file;
    release inode parent directory (algorithm iput);
    decrement file link count;
    release file inode (algorithm iput);
        /* iput checks if link count is 0: if so,
         * releaseS file blocks (algorithm free) and
         * frees inode (algorithm ifree);
        */
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Figure 5.31.</strong> Algorithm for Unlinking a File</p>

<p>Figure 5.31 gives the algorithm for <em>unlinking</em> a file. The kernel first uses a variation of algorithm <em>namei</em> to find the file that it must <em>unlink</em>, but instead of returning its inode, it returns the inode of the parent directory. It accesses the in-core inode of the file to be <em>unlinked</em>, using algorithm <em>iget</em>. (The special case for unlinking the file &ldquo;.&rdquo; is covered in an exercise.) After checking error conditions and, for executable files, removing inactive shared text entries from the region table (Chapter 7), the kernel clears the file name from the parent directory: Writing a 0 for the value of the inode number suffices to clear the slot in the directory. The kernel then does a synchronous write of the directory to disk to ensure that the file is inaccessible by its old name, decrements the link count, and releases the in-core inodes of the parent directory and the unlinked file via algorithm <em>iput</em>.</p>

<p>When releasing the in-core inode of the unlinked file in <em>iput</em>, if the reference count drops to 0, and if the link count is 0, the kernel reclaims the disk blocks occupied by the file. No file names refer to the inode any longer and the inode is not active. To reclaim the disk blocks, the kernel loops through the inode table of contents, freeing all direct blocks immediately (according to algorithm <em>free</em>). For the indirect blocks, it recursively frees all blocks that appear in the various levels of indirection, freeing the more direct blocks first. It zeroes out the block numbers in the inode table of contents and sets the file size in the inooe to 0. It then clears the inode file type field to indicate that the inode is free and frees the inode with algorithm <em>ifree</em>. It updates the disk since the disk copy of the inode still indicated that. the inode was in use; the inode is now free for assignment to other files.</p>

<h2 id="5-16-1-file-system-consistency">5.16.1 File System Consistency</h2>

<p>The kernel orders its writes to disk to minimize file system corruption in event of system failure. For instance, when it removes a file name from its parent directory, it writes the directory synchronously to the disk - before it destroys the contents of the file and frees the inode. If the system were to crash before the file contents were removed, damage to the file system would be minimal: There would be an inode that would have a link count 1 greater than the number of directory entries that access it, but all other paths to the file would still be legal. If the directory write were not synchronous, it would be possible for the directory entry on disk to point to a free (or reallocated!) inode after a system crash. Thus there would be more directory entries in the file system that refer to the inode than the inode would have link counts. In particular, if the file name was that of the last link to the file, it would refer to an unallocated inode. System damage is clearly less severe and easier to correct in the first case (see Section 5.18).</p>

<p>For example, suppose a file has two links with path names &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo;, and suppose a process <em>unlinks</em> &ldquo;a&rdquo;. If the kernel orders the disk write operations, then it zeros the directory entry for &ldquo;a&rdquo; and writes it to disk. If the system crashes after the write to disk completes, file &ldquo;b&rdquo; has link count of 2, but file &ldquo;a&rdquo; does not exist because its old entry had been zeroed before the system crash. File &ldquo;b&rdquo; has an extra link count, but the system functions properly when rebooted.</p>

<p>Now suppose the kernel ordered the disk write operations in the reverse order and the system crashes: That is, it decrements the link count for the file &ldquo;b&rdquo; to 1, writes the inode to disk, and crashes before it could zero the directory entry for file &ldquo;a&rdquo;. When the system is rebooted, entries for files &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; exist in their respective directories, but the link count for the file they reference is 1. If a process then <em>unlinks</em> file &ldquo;a&rdquo;, the file link count drops to 0 even though file &ldquo;b&rdquo; still references the inode. If the kernel were later to reassign the inode as the result of a <em>creat</em> system call, the new file would have link count 1 but two path names that reference it. The system cannot rectify the situation except via maintenance programs (<em>fsck</em>, described in Section 5.18) that access the file system through the block or raw interface.</p>

<p>The kernel also frees inodes and disk blocks in a specific order to minimize corruption in event of system failure. When removing the contents of a file and clearing its inode, it is possible to free the blocks containing the file data first, or it is possible to free and write out the inode first. The result is usually identical for both cases, but it differs if the system crashes in the middle. Suppose the kernel first frees the disk blocks of a file and crashes. When the system is rebooted, the inode still contains references to the old disk blocks, which may no longer contain data relevant to the file. The kernel would see an apparently good file, but a user accessing the file would notice corruption. It is also possible that other files were assigned those disk blocks. The effort to clean the file system with the <em>fsck</em> program would be great. However, if the system first writes the inode to disk and the system crashes, a user would not notice anything wrong with the file system when the system is rebooted. The data blocks that previously belonged to the file would be inaccessible to the system, but users would notice no apparent corruption. The <em>fsck</em> program also finds the task of reclaiming unlinked disk blocks easier than the clean-up it would have to do for the first sequence of events.</p>

<h2 id="5-16-2-race-conditions">5.16.2 Race Conditions</h2>

<p>Race conditions abound in the <em>unlink</em> system call, particularly when unlinking directories. The <em>rmdir</em> command removes a directory after verifying that the directory contains no files (it <em>reads</em> the directory and checks that all directory entries have inode value 0). But since <em>rmdir</em> runs at user level, the actions of verifying that a directory is empty and removing the directory are not atomic; the system could do a context switch between execution of the <em>read</em> and <em>unlink</em> system calls. Hence, another process could <em>creat</em> a file in the directory after <em>rmdir</em> determined that the directory was empty. Users can prevent this situation only by use of file and record locking. Once a process begins execution of the <em>unlink</em> call, however, no other process can access the file being unlinked since the inodes of the parent directory and the file are locked.</p>

<p>Recall the algorithm for the <em>link</em> system call and how the kernel unlocks the inode before completion of the call. If another process should <em>unlink</em> the file while the inode lock is free, it would only decrement the link count; since the link count had been incremented before unlinking the inode, the count would still be greater than 0. Hence, the file cannot be removed, and the system is safe. The condition is equivalent to the case where the <em>unlink</em> happens immediately after the <em>link</em> call completes.</p>

<p>Another race condition exists in the case where one process is converting a file path name to an inode using algorithm <em>namei</em> and another process is removing a directory in that path. Suppose process A is parsing the path name &ldquo;a/b/c/d&rdquo; and goes to sleep while allocating the in-core inode for &ldquo;c&rdquo;. It could go to sleep while trying to lock the inode or while trying to access the disk block in which the inode resides (see algorithms <em>iget</em> and <em>bread</em>). If process B wants to <em>unlink</em> the directory &ldquo;c&rdquo;, it may go to sleep, possibly for the same reasons that process A is sleeping. Suppose the kernel later schedules process B to run before process A. Process B would run to completion, unlinking directory &ldquo;c&rdquo; and removing it and its contents (for the last link) before process A runs again. Later, process A would try to access an illegal in-core inode that had been removed. Algorithm <em>namei</em> therefore checks that the link count is not 0 before proceeding, reporting an error otherwise.</p>

<p>The check is not sufficient, however, because another process could conceivably create a new directory somewhere in the file system and allocate the inode that had previously been used for &ldquo;c&rdquo;. Process A is tricked into thinking that it accessed the correct inode (see Figure 5.32). Nevertheless, the system maintains its integrity; the worst that could happen is that the wrong file is accessed - a possible security breach - but the race condition is rare in practice.</p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure5.32.jpg" alt="figure 5.32" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5.32.</strong> Unlink Race Condition</p>

<p>A process can <em>unlink</em> a file while another process has the file open. (The unlinking process could even be the process that did the open). Since the kernel unlocks the inode at the end of the open call, the <em>unlink</em> call will succeed. The kernel will follow the <em>unlink</em> algorithm as if the file were not open, and it will remove the directory entry for the file. No other processes will be able to access the now <em>unlinked</em> file. However, since the <em>open</em> system call had incremented the inode reference count, the kernel does not clear the file contents when executing the <em>iput</em> algorithm at the conclusion of the <em>unlink</em> call. So the opening process can do all the normal file operations with its file descriptor, including reading and writing the file. But when it closes the file, the inode reference count drops to 0 in <em>iput</em>, and the kernel clears the contents of the file. In short, the process that had opened the file proceeds as if the <em>unlink</em> did not occur, and the <em>unlink</em> happens as if the file were not open. Other system calls will continue to work for the opening process, too.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5.33.</strong> Unlinking an Opened File</p>

<p>In Figure 5.33 for example, a process <em>opens</em> a file supplied as a parameter and then <em>unlinks</em> the file it just opened. The <em>stat</em> call fails because the original path name no longer refers to a file after the <em>unlink</em> (assuming no other process created a file by that name in the meantime), but the <em>fstat</em> call succeeds because it gets to the inode via the file descriptor. The process loops, <em>reading</em> the file 1024 bytes at a time and printing the file to the standard output. When the <em>read</em> encounters the end of the file, the process <em>exits</em>: After the close in <em>exit</em>, the file no longer exists. Processes commonly create temporary files and immediately unlink them; they can continue to read and write them, but the file name no longer appears in the directory hierarchy. If the process should fail for some reason, it leaves no trail of temporary files behind it.</p>
