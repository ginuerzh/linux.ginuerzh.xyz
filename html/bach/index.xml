      <description>The UNIX system was first described in a 1974 paper in the Communications of the ACM [Thompson 74] by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Since that time, it has become increasingly widespread and popular throughout the computer industry where more and more vendors are offering support for it on their machines. It is especially popular in universities where it is frequently used for operating systems research and case studies.
Many books and papers have described parts of the system, among them, two special issues of the Bell System Technical Journal in 1978 [BSTJ 78] and 1984 [BLTJ 84].</description>
