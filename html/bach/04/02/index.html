        <p>As mentioned above, the inode contains the table of contents to locate a file&rsquo;s data on disk. Since each block on a disk is addressable by number, the table of contents consists of a set of disk block numbers. If the data in a file were stored in a contiguous section of the disk (that is, the file occupied a linear sequence of disk blocks), then storing the start block address and the file size in the inode would suffice to access all the data in the file. However, such an allocation strategy would not allow for simple expansion and contraction of files in the file system without running the risk of fragmenting free storage area on the disk. Furthermore, the kernel would have to allocate and reserve contiguous space in the file system before allowing operations that would increase the file size.</p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure4.5a.jpg" alt="figure 4.5a" /></p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure4.5b.jpg" alt="figure 4.5b" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4.5.</strong> Allocation of Contiguous Files and Fragmentation of Free Space</p>

<p>For example, suppose a user creates three files, A, B and C, each consisting of 10 disk blocks of storage, and suppose the system allocated storage for the three files contiguously. If the user then wishes to add 5 blocks of data to the middle file, B, the kernel would have to copy file B to a place in the file system that had room for 15 blocks of storage. Aside from the expense of such an operation, the disk blocks previously occupied by file B&rsquo;s data would be unusable except for files smaller than 10 blocks (Figure 4.5). The kernel could minimize fragmentation of storage space by periodically running garbage collection procedures to compact available storage, but that would place an added drain on processing power.</p>

<p>For greater flexibility, the kernel allocates file space one block at a time and allows the data in a file to be spread throughout the file system. But this allocation scheme complicates the task of locating the data. The table of contents could consist of a list of block numbers such that the blocks contain the data belonging to the file, but simple calculations show that a linear list of file blocks in the inode is
difficult to manage. If a logical block contains 1K bytes, then a file consisting of 10K bytes would require an index of 10 block numbers, but a file containing 100K bytes would require an index of 100 block numbers. Either the size of the inode would vary according to the size of the file, or a relatively low limit would have to be placed on the size of a file.</p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure4.6.jpg" alt="figure 4.6" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4.6.</strong> Direct and Indirect Blocks in Inode</p>

<p>To keep the inode structure small yet still allow large files, the table of contents of disk blocks conforms to that shown in Figure 4.6. The System V UNIX system runs with 13 entries in the inode table of contents, but the principles are independent of the number of entries. The blocks marked &ldquo;direct&rdquo; in the figure contain the numbers of disk blocks that contain real data. The block marked &ldquo;single indirect&rdquo; refers to a block that contains a list of direct block numbers. To access the data via the indirect block, the kernel must read the indirect block, find the appropriate direct block entry, and then read the direct block to find the data. The block marked &ldquo;double indirect&rdquo; contains a list of indirect block numbers, and the block marked &ldquo;triple indirect&rdquo; contains a list of double indirect block numbers.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">10 direct blocks with 1 K bytes each =                      10K bytes
1 indirect block with 256 direct blocks =                   256K bytes
1 double indirect block with 256 indirect blocks =          64M bytes
1 triple indirect block with 256 double indirect blocks =   16G bytes
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Figure 4.7.</strong> Byte Capacity of a File - 1K Bytes Per Block</p>

<p>In principle, the method could be extended to support &ldquo;quadruple indirect blocks,&rdquo; &ldquo;quintuple indirect blocks,&rdquo; and so on, but the current structure has sufficed in practice. Assume that a logical block on the file system holds 1K bytes and that a block number is addressable by a 32 bit (4 byte) integer. Then a block can hold up to 256 block numbers. The maximum number of bytes that could be held in a file is calculated (Figure 4.7) at well over 16 gigabytes, using 10 direct blocks and 1 indirect, 1 double indirect, and 1 triple indirect block in the inode. Given that the file size field in the inode is 32 bits, the size of a file is effectively limited to 4 gigabytes (2<sup>32</sup>).</p>

<p>Processes access data in a file by byte offset. They work in terms of byte counts and view a file as a stream of bytes starting at byte address 0 and going up to the size of the file. The kernel converts the user view of bytes into a view of blocks: The file starts at logical block 0 and continues to a logical block number corresponding to the file size. The kernel accesses the inode and converts the logical file block into the appropriate disk block. Figure 4.8 gives the algorithm <em>bmap</em> for converting a file byte offset into a physical disk block.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">algorithm bmap /* block map of logical file byte offset to file system block */
input:  (1) inode
        (2) byte offset
output: (1) block number in file system
        (2) byte offset into block
        (3) bytes of I/O in block
        (4) read ahead block number
{
    calculate logical block number in file from byte offset;
    calculate start byte in block for I/O;      /* output 2 */
    calculate number of bytes to copy to user;  /* output 3 */
    check if read-ahead applicable, mark inode; /* output 4 */
    determine level of indirection;
    while (not at necessary level of indirection)
    {
        calculate index into inode or indirect block from
                    logical block number in file;
        get disk block number from inode or indirect block;
        release buffer from previous disk read, if any (algorithm brelse);
        if (no more levels of indirection)
            return (block number);
        read indirect disk block (algorithm bread);
        adjust logical block number in file according to level of indirection;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Figure 4.8.</strong> Conversion of Byte Offset to Block Number in File System</p>

<p>Consider the block layout for the file in Figure 4.9 and assume that a disk block contains 1024 bytes. If a process wants to access byte offset 9000, the kernel calculates that the byte is in direct block 8 in the file (counting from 0). It then accesses block number 367; the 808th byte in that block (starting from 0) is byte 9000 in the file. If a process want to access byte offset 350,000 in the file, it must access a double indirect block number 9156 in the figure. Since an indirect block has room for 256 block numbers, the first byte accessed via the double indirect block is byte number 272,384 (256K + 10K); byte number 350,000 in a file is therefore byte number 77,616 of the double indirect block. Since each single indirect block accesses 256K bytes, byte number 350,000 must be in the 0th single indirect block of the double indirect block - block number 331. Since each direct block in a single indirect block contains 1K bytes, byte number 77,616 of a single indirect block is in the 75th direct block in the single indirect block - block number 3333. Finally, byte number 350,000 in the file is at byte number 816 in block 3333.</p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure4.9.jpg" alt="figure 4.9" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4.9.</strong> Block Layout of a Sample File and its Inode</p>

<p>Examining Figure 4.9 more closely, several block entries in the inode are 0, meaning that the logical block entries contain no data. This happens if no process ever wrote data into the file at any byte offsets corresponding to those blocks and hence the block numbers remain at their initial value, 0. No disk space is wasted for such blocks. Processes can cause such a block layout in a file by using the <em>lseek</em> and <em>write</em> system calls, as described in the next chapter. The next chapter also describes how the kernel takes care of read system calls that access such blocks.</p>

<p>The conversion of a large byte offset, particularly one that is referenced via the triple indirect block, is an arduous procedure that could require the kernel to access three disk blocks in addition to the inode and data block. Even if the kernel finds the blocks in the buffer cache, the operation is still expensive, because the kernel must make multiple requests of the buffer cache and may have to sleep awaiting locked buffers. How effective is the algorithm in practice? That depends on bow the system is used and whether the user community and job mix are such that the kernel accesses large files or small files more frequently. It has been observed [Mullender 84], however, that most files on UNIX systems contain less than 10K bytes, and many contain less than 1K bytes!<sup>1</sup>. Since 10K bytes of a file are stored in direct blocks, most file data can be accessed with one disk access. So in spite of the fact that accessing large files is an expensive operation, accessing common-sized files is fast.</p>

<p>Two extensions to the inode structure just described attempt to take advantage of file size characteristics. A major principle in the 4.2 BSD file system implementation [McKusick 84] is that the more data the kernel can access on the disk in a single operation, the faster file access becomes. That argues for having larger logical disk blocks, and the Berkeley implementation allows logical disk blocks of 4K or 8K bytes. But having larger block sizes on disk increases block fragmentation, leaving large portions of disk space unused. For instance, if the logical block size is 8K bytes; then a file of size 12K bytes uses 1 complete block and half of a second block. The other half of the second block (4K bytes) is wasted; no other file can use the space for data storage. If the sizes of files are such that the number of bytes in the last block of a file is uniformly distributed, then the average wasted space is half a block per file; the amount of wasted disk space can be as high as 45% for a file system with logical blocks of size 4K bytes [McKusick 84]. The Berkeley implementation remedies the situation by allocating a block <em>fragment</em> to contain the last data in a file. One disk block can contain fragments belonging to several files. An exercise in Chapter 5 explores some details of the implementation.</p>

<p>The second extension to the classic inode structure described here is to store file data in the inode (see [Mullender 84]). By expanding the inode to occupy an entire disk block, a small portion of the block can be used for the inode structures and the remainder of the block can store the entire file, in many cases, or the end of a file otherwise. The main advantage is that only one disk acCess is necessary to
get the inode and its data if the file fits in the inode block.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li>For a sample of 19,978 files, Mullender and Tannenbaum say that approximately 85% of the files were smaller than 8K bytes and that 48% were smaller than 1K bytes. Although these percentages will vary from one installation to the next, they are representative of many UNIX systems.</li>
