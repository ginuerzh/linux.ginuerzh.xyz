<p>The execution of user processes on UNIX systems is divided into two levels: user and kernel. When a process executes a system call, the <em>execution mode</em> of the process changes from <em>user mode</em> to <em>kernel mode</em>: the operating system executes and attempts to service the user request, returning an error code if it fails. Even if the user makes no explicit requests for operating system services, the operating system still does bookkeeping operations that relate to the user process, handling interrupts, scheduling processes, managing memory, and so on. Many machine architectures (and their operating systems) support more levels than the two outlined here, but the two modes, user and kernel, are sufficient for UNIX systems.</p>

<p>The differences between the two modes are</p>

<ul>
<li>Processes in user mode can access their own instructions and data but not kernel instructions and data (or those of other processes). Processes in kernel mode, however, can access kernel and user addresses. For example, the virtual address space of a process may be divided between addresses that are accessible only in kernel mode and addresses that are accessible in either mode.</li>
<li>Some machine instructions are privileged and result in an error when executed in user mode. For example, a machine may contain an instruction that manipulates the processor status register; processes executing in user mode should not have this capability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put simply, the hardware views the world in terms of kernel mode and user mode and does not distinguish among the many users executing programs in those modes. The operating system keeps internal records to distinguish the many processes executing on the system. Figure 1.5 shows the distinction: the kernel distinguishes between processes A, B, C, and D on the horizontal axis, and the hardware distinguishes the mode of execution on the vertical axis.</p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure1.5.jpg" alt="figure 1.5" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.5.</strong> Multiple Processes and Modes of Execution</p>

<p>Although the system executes in one of two modes, the kernel runs on behalf of a user process. The kernel is not a separate set of processes that run in parallel to user processes, but it is part of each user process. The ensuing text will frequently refer to &ldquo;the kernel&rdquo; allocating resources or &ldquo;the kernel&rdquo; doing various operations, but what is meant is that a process executing in kernel mode allocates the resources or does the various operations. For example, the shell reads user terminal input via a system call: The kernel, executing on behalf of the shell process, controls the operation of the terminal and returns the typed characters to the shell. The shell then executes in user mode, interprets the character stream typed by the user, and does the specified set of actions, which may require invocation of other system calls.</p>

<h2 id="1-5-1-interrupts-and-exceptions">1.5.1 Interrupts and Exceptions</h2>

<p>The UNIX system allows devices such as I/O peripherals or the system clock to interrupt the CPU asynchronously. On receipt of the interrupt, the kernel saves its current <em>context</em> (a frozen image of what the process was doing), determines the cause of the interrupt, and services the interrupt. After the kernel services the interrupt, it restores its interrupted context and proceeds as if nothing had happened. The hardware usually prioritizes devices according to the order that interrupts should be handled: When the kernel services an interrupt, it <em>blocks</em> out lower priority interrupts but services higher priority interrupts.</p>

<p>An exception condition refers to unexpected events caused by a process, such as addressing illegal memory, executing privileged instructions, dividing by zero, and so on. They are distinct from interrupts, which are caused by events that are external to a process. Exceptions happen &ldquo;in the middle&rdquo; of the execution of an instruction, and the system attempts to restart the instruction after handling the exception; interrupts are considered to happen between the execution of two instructions, and the system continues with the next instruction after servicing the interrupt. The UNIX system uses one mechanism to handle interrupts and exception conditions.</p>

<h2 id="1-5-2-processor-execution-levels">1.5.2 Processor Execution Levels</h2>

<p>The kernel must sometimes prevent the occurrence of interrupts during critical activity, which could result in corrupt data if interrupts were allowed. For instance, the kernel may not want to receive a disk interrupt while manipulating linked lists, because handling the interrupt could corrupt the pointers, as will be seen in the next chapter. Computers typically have a set of privileged instructions that set the processor execution level in the processor status word. Setting the processor execution level to certain values masks off interrupts from that level and lower levels, allowing only higher-level interrupts. Figure 1.6 shows a sample set of execution levels. If the kernel masks out disk interrupts, all interrupts except for clock interrupts and machine error interrupts are prevented. If it masks out software interrupts, all other interrupts may occur.</p>

<p><img src="/linux/img/bach/figure1.6.jpg" alt="figure 1.6" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.6.</strong> Typical Interrupt Levels</p>

<h2 id="1-5-3-memory-management">1.5.3 Memory Management</h2>

<p>The kernel permanently resides in main memory as does the currently executing process (or parts of it, at least). When compiling a program, the compiler generates a set of addresses in the program. that represent addresses of variables and data structures or the addresses of instructions such as functions. The compiler generates the addresses for a <em>virtual machine</em> as if no other program will execute simultaneously on the physical machine.</p>

<p>When the program is to run on the machine, the kernel allocates space in main memory for it, but the <em>virtual addresses</em> generated by the compiler need not be identical to the physical addresses that they occupy in the machine. The kernel coordinates with the machine hardware to set up a <em>virtual to physical</em> address translation that maps the compiler-generated addresses to the physical machine addresses. The mapping depends on the capabilities of the machine hardware, and the parts of UNIX systems that deal with them are therefore machine dependent. For example, some machines have special hardware to support demand paging. Chapters 6 and 9 will discuss issues of memory management and how they relate to hardware in more detail.</p>
