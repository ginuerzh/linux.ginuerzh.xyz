The UNIX system has become quite popular since its inception in 1969, running on machines of varying processing power from microprocessors to mainframes and providing a common execution environment across them. The system is divided into two parts. The first part consists of programs and services that have made the UNIX system environment so popular; it is the part readily apparent to users including such programs as the shell, mail, text processing packages, and source code control systems. The second part consists of the operating system that supports these programs and services. This book gives a detailed description of the operating system. It concentrates on a description of UNIX System V produced by AT&T but considers interesting features provided by other versions too. It examines the major data structures and algorithms used in the operating system that ultimately provide users with the standard user interface.

This chapter provides an introduction to the UNIX system. It reviews its history and outlines the overall system structure. The next chapter gives a more detailed introduction to the operating system.
