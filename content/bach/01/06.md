This chapter has described the overall structure of the UNIX system, the relationship between processes running in user mode versus kernel mode, and the assumptions the kernel makes about the hardware. Processes execute in user mode or kernel mode, where they avail themselves of system services using a well-defined set of system calls. The system design encourages programmers to write small programs that do only a few operations but do them well, and then to combine the programs using *pipes* and I/O redirection to do more sophisticated processing.

The system calls allow processes to do operations that are otherwise forbidden to them. In addition to servicing system calls, the kernel does general bookkeeping for the user community, controlling process scheduling, managing the storage and protection of processes in main memory, fielding interrupts, managing files and devices, and taking care of system error conditions. The UNIX system kernel purposely omits many functions that are part of other operating systems, providing a small set of system calls that allow processes to do necessary functions at user level. The next chapter gives a more detailed introduction to the kernel, describing its architecture and some basic concepts used in its implementation.
