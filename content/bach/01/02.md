**Figure 1.1.** Architecture of UNIX Systems

Figure 1.1 depict the high-level architecture of the UNIX system. The hardware at the center of the diagram provides the operating system with basic services that will be described in Section 1.5. The operating system interacts directly<sup>1</sup> with the hardware, providing common services to programs and insulating them from hardware idiosyncrasies. Viewing the system as a set of layers, the operating system is commonly called the system kernel, or just the kernel, emphasizing its isolation from user programs. Because programs are independent of the underlying hardware, it is easy to move them between UNIX systems running on different hardware if the programs do not make assumptions about the underlying hardware. For instance, programs that assume the size of a machine word are more difficult to move to other machines than programs that do not make this assumption.

Programs such as the shell and editors (*ed* and *vi*) shown in the outer layers interact with the kernel by invoking a well defined set of *system calls*. The system calls instruct the kernel to do various operations for the calling program and exchange data between the kernel and the program. Several programs shown in the figure are in standard system configurations and are known as *commands*, but private user programs may also exist in this layer as indicated by the program whose name is *a.out*, the standard name for executable files produced by the C compiler. Other application programs can build on top of lower-level programs, hence the existence of the outermost layer in the figure. For example, the standard
C compiler, *cc*, is in the outermost layer of the figure: it invokes a C preprocessor, two-pass compiler assembler, and loader (link-editor), all separate lower-level programs. Although the figure depicts a two-level hierarchy of application programs, users can extend the hierarchy to whatever levels are appropriate. Indeed, the style of programming favored by the UNIX system encourages the combination of existing programs to accomplish a task.

Many application subsystems and programs that provide a high-level view of the system such as the shell, editors, SCCS (Source Code Control System) , and document preparation packages, have gradually become synonymous with the name "UNIX system." However, they all use lower-level services ultimately provided by the kernel, and they avail themselves of these services via the set of system calls. There are about 64 system calls in System V, of which fewer than 32 are used frequently. They have simple options that make them easy to use but provide the user with a lot of power. The set of system calls and the internal algorithms that implement them form the body of the kernel, and the study of the UNIX operating system presented in this book reduces to a detailed study and analysis of the system calls and their interaction with one another. In short, the kernel provides the services upon which all application programs in the UNIX system rely, and it defines those services. This book will frequently use the terms "UNIX system," "kernel," or "system," but the intent is to refer to the kernel of the UNIX operating system and should be clear in context.

1. In some implementations of the UNIX system, the operating system interacts with a native operating system that, in turn, interacts with the underlyihg hardware and provides necessary services to the system. Such configurations allow installations to run other operating systems and their applications in parallel to the UNIX system. The classic example of such a configuration is the MERT system [Lycklama 78a]. More recent configurations include implementations for IBM System/370 computers [Felton 84] and for UNIVAC 1100 Series computers [Bodenstab 84].
