When a process writes data to a file, the kernel must allocate disk blocks from the file system for direct data blocks and, sometimes, for indirect blocks. The file system super block contains an array that is used to cache the numbers of free disk blocks in the file system. The utility program *mkfs* (make file system) organizes the data blocks of a file system in a linked list, such that each link of the list is a disk block that contains an array of free disk block numbers, and one array entry is the number of the next block of the linked list. Figure 4.18 shows an example of the linked list, where the first block is the super block free list and later blocks on the linked list contain more free block numbers.

When the kernel wants to allocate a block from a file system (algorithm *alloc*, Figure 4.19), it allocates the next available block in the super block list. Once allocated, the block cannot be reallocated until it becomes free. If the allocated block is the last available block in the super block cache, the kernel treats it as a pointer to a block that contains a list of free blocks. It reads the block, populates the super block array with the new list of block numbers, and then proceeds to use the original block number. It allocates a buffer for the block and clears the buffer's data (zeros it). The disk block has now been assigned, and the kernel has a buffer to work with. If the file system contains no free blocks, the calling process receives an error.

If a process *writes* a lot of data to a file, it repeatedly asks the system for blocks to store the data, but the kernel assigns only one block at a time. The program *mkfs* tries to organize the original linked list of free block numbers so that block numbers dispensed to a file are near each other. This helps performance, because it reduces disk seek time and latency when a process reads a file sequentially. Figure 4.18 depicts block numbers in a regular pattern, presumably based on the disk rotation speed. Unfortunately, the order of block numbers on the free block linked lists breaks down with heavy use as processes *write* files and remove them, because block numbers enter and leave the free list at random. The kernel makes no attempt to sort block numbers on the free list.

**Figure 4.18.** Linked List of Free Disk Block Numbers

The algorithm *free* for freeing a block is the reverse of the one for allocating a block. If the super block list is not full, the block number of the newly freed block is placed on the super block list. If, however, the super block list is full, the newly freed block becomes a link block; the kernel writes the super block list into the block and writes the block to disk. It then places the block number of the newly
freed block in the super block list: That block number is the only member of the list.

```text
algorithm alloc /* file system block allocation */
input:  file system number
output: buffer for new block
{
    while (super block locked)
        sleep (event super block not locked);
    remove block from super block free list;
    if (removed last block from free list)
    {
        lock super block;
        read block just taken from free list (algorithm bread);
        copy block numbers in block into super block;
        release block buffer (algorithm brelse);
        unlock super block;
        wake up processes (event super block not locked);
    }
    get buffer for block removed from super block list (algorithm getblk);
    zero buffer contents;
    decrement total count of free blocks;
    mark super block modified;
    return buffer;
}
```

**Figure 4.19.** Algorithm for Allocating Disk Block

Figure 4.20 shows a sequence of *alloc* and *free* operations, starting with one entry on the super block free list. The kernel frees block 949 and places the block number on the free list. It then allocates a block and removes block number 949 from the free list. Finally, it allocates a block and removes block number 109 from the free list. Because the super block free list is now empty, the kernel replenishes the list by copying in the contents of block 109, the next link on the linked list. Figure 4.20(d) shows the full super block list and the next link block, block 211.

The algorithms for assigning and freeing inodes and disk blocks are similar in that the kernel uses the super block as a cache containing indices of free resources. block numbers, and inode numbers. It maintains a linked list of block numbers such that every free block number in the file system appears in some element of the linked list, but it maintains no such list of free inodes. There are three reasons for the different treatment.

1. The kernel can determine whether an inode is free by inspection: If the file type field is clear, the inode is free. The kernel needs no other mechanism to describe free inodes. However, it cannot determine whether a block is free just by looking at it. It could not distinguish between a bit pattern that indicates the block is free and data that happened to have that bit pattern. Hence, the kernel requires an external method to identify free blocks, and traditional implementations have used a linked list.
2. Disk blocks lend themselves to the use of linked lists: A disk block easily holds large lists of free block numbers. But inodes have no convenient place for bulk storage of large lists of free inode numbers.
3. Users tend to consume disk block resources more quickly than they consume inodes, so the apparent lag in performance when searching the disk for free inodes is not as critical as it would be for searching for free disk blocks.
