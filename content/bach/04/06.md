The kernel uses algorithm *iget* to allocate a known inode, one whose (file system and) inode number was previously determined. In algorithm *namei* for instance, the kernel determines the inode number by matching a path name component to a name in a directory. Another algorithm, *ialloc*, assigns a disk inode to a newly created file.

The file system contains a linear list of inodes, as mentioned in Chapter 2. An inode is free if its type field is zero. When a process needs a new inode, the kernel could theoretically search the inode list for a free inode. However, such a search would be expensive, requiring at least one read operation (possibly from disk) for every inode. To improve performance, the file system super block contains an array to cache the numbers of free inodes in the file system.

```text
algorithm ialloc    /* allocate inode */
input:  file system
output: locked inode
{
    while (not done)
    {
        if (super block locked)
        {
            sleep (event super block becomes free);
            continue; /* while loop */
        }
        if (inode list in super block is empty)
        {
            lock super block;
            get remembered inode for free inode search;
            search disk for free inodes until super block full, or no more free inodes (algorithms bread and brelse);
            unlock super block;
            wake up (event super block becomes free);
            if (no free inodes found on disk)
                return (no inode);
            set remembered inode for next free inode search;
        }
        /* there are inodes in super block inode list */
        get inode number from super block inode list;
        get inode (algorithm iget);
        if (inode not free after all)       /* !!! */
        {
            write inode to disk;
            release inode (algorithm iput);
            continue; /* while loop */
        }
        /* inode is free */
        initialize inode;
        write inode to disk;
        decrement file system free inode count;
        return (inode);
    }
}
```

**Figure 4.12.** Algorithm for Assigning New Inodes

Figure 4.12 shows the algorithm *ialloc* for assigning new inodes. For reasons cited later, the kernel first verifies that no other processes have locked access to the super block free inode list. If the list of inode numbers in the super block is not empty, the kernel assigns the next inode number, allocates a free in-core inode for the newly assigned disk inode using algorithm *iget* (reading the inode from disk if necessary) , copies the disk inode to the in-core copy, initializes the fields in the inode, and returns the locked inode. It updates the disk inode to indicate that the inode is now in use: A non-zero file type field indicates that the disk inode is assigned. In the simplest case, the kernel has a good inode, but race conditions exist that necessitate more checking, as will be explained shortly. Loosely defined, a race condition arises when several processes alter common data structures such that the resulting computations depend on the order in which the processes executed, even though all processes obeyed the locking protocol. For example, it is implied here that a process could get a used inode. A race condition is related to the mutual exclusion problem defined in Chapter 2, except that locking schemes solve the mutual exclusion problem there but may not, by themselves, solve all race conditions.

If the super block list of free inodes is empty, the kernel searches the disk and places as many free inode numbers as possible into the super block. The kernel reads the inode list on disk, block by block, and fills the super block list of inode numbers to capacity, remembering the highest-numbered inode that it finds. Call that inode the "remembered" inode; it is the last one saved in the super block. The next time the kernel searches the disk for free inodes, it uses the remembered inode as its starting point, thereby assuring that it wastes no time reading disk blocks where no free inodes should exist. After gathering a fresh set of free inode numbers, it starts the inode assignment algorithm from the beginning. Whenever the kernel assigns a disk inode, it decrements the free inode count recorded in the super block.

**Figure 4.13.** Two Arrays of Free Inode Numbers

Consider the two pairs of arrays of free inode numbers in Figure 4.13. If the list of free inodes in the super block looks like the first array in Figure 4.13(a) when the kernel assigns an inode, it decrements the index for the next valid inode number to 18 and takes inode number 48. If the list of free inodes in the super block looks like the first array in Figure 4.13(b), it will notice that the array is empty and search the disk for free inodes, starting from inode number 470, the remembered inode. When the kernel fills the super block free list to capacity, it remembers the last inode as the start point for the next search of the disk. The kernel assigns an inode it just took from the disk (number 471 in the figure) and
continues whatever it was doing.

```text
algorithm ifree /* inode free */
input:  file system inode number
output: none
{
    increment file system free inode count;
    if (super block locked)
        return;
    if (inode list full)
    {
        if (inode number less than remembered inode for search)
            set remembered inode for search = input inode number;
    }
    else
        store inode number in inode list;
    return;
}
```

**Figure 4.14.** Algorithm for Freeing Inode

The algorithm for freeing an inode is much simpler. After incrementing the total number of available inodes in the file system, the kernel checks the lock on the super block. If locked, it avoids race conditions by returning immediately: The inode number is not put into the super block, but it can be found on disk and is available for reassignment. If the list is not locked, the kernel checks if it has room for more inode numbers and, if it does, places the inode number in the list and returns. If the list is full, the kernel may not save the newly freed inode there: It compares the number of the freed inode with that of the remembered inode. If the freed inode number is less than the remembered inode number, it "remembers" the newly freed inode number. discarding the old remembered inode number from the super block. The inode is not lost, because the kernel can find it by searching the inode list on disk. The kernel maintains the super block list such that the last inode it dispenses from the list is the remembered inode. Ideally, there should never be free inodes whose inode number is less than the remembered inode number, but exceptions are possible.

**Figure 4.15.** Placing Free Inode Numbers into the Super Block

Consider two examples of freeing inodes. If the super block list of free inodes has room for more free inode numbers as in Figure 4.13(a), the kernel places the inode number on the list, increments the-index to the next free inode, and proceeds. But if the list of free inodes is full as in Figure 4.15, the kernel compares the inode number it has freed to the remembered inode number that will start the next disk
search. Starting with the free inode list in Figure 4.15(a), if the kernel frees inode 499, it makes 499 the remembered inode and evicts number 535 from the free list. If the kernel then frees inode number 601, it does not change the contents of the free list. When it later uses up the inodes in the super block free list, it will search the disk for free inodes starting from inode number 499, and find inodes 535 and
601 again.

**Figure 4.17.** Race Condition in Assigning Inodes (continued)

The preceding paragraph described the simple cases of the algorithms. Now consider the case where the kernel assigns a new inode and then allocates an in-core copy for the inode. The algorithm implies that the kernel could find that the inode had already been assigned. Although rare, the following scenario shows such a case (refer to Figures 4.16 and 4.17). Consider three processes, A, B, and C, and suppose that the kernel, acting on behalf of process A,<sup>3</sup> assigns inode I but goes to sleep before it copies the disk inode into the in-core copy. Algorithms *iget* (invoked by *ialloc*) and *bread* (invoked by *iget*) give process A ample opportunity to go to sleep. While process A is asleep, suppose process B attempts to assign a new inode but discovers that the super block list of free inodes is empty. Process B searches the disk for free inodes, and suppose it starts its search for free inodes at an inode number lower than that of the inode that A is assigning. It is possible for process B to find inode I free on the disk since process A is still asleep, and the kernel does not know that the inode is about to be assigned. Process B, not realizing the danger, completes its search of the disk, fills up the super block with (supposedly) free inodes, assigns an inode, and departs from the scene. However, inode I is in the super block free list of inode numbers. When process A wakes up, it completes the assignment of inode I. Now suppose process C later requests an inode and happens to pick inode I from the super block free list. When it gets the in-core copy of the inode, it will find its file type set, implying that the inode was already assigned. The kernel checks for this condition and, finding that the inode has been assigned, tries to assign a new one. Writing the updated inode to disk immediately after its assignment in *ialloc* makes the chance of the race smaller, because the file type field will mark the inode in use.

Locking the super block list of inodes while reading in a new set from disk prevents other race conditions. If the super block list were not locked, a process could find it empty and try to populate it from disk, occasionally sleeping while waiting for I/O completion. Suppose a second process also tried to assign a new inode and found the list empty. It, too, would try to populate the list from disk. At best, the two processes are duplicating their efforts and wasting CPU power. At worst, race conditions of the type described in the previous paragraph would be more frequent. Similarly, if a process freeing an inode did not check that the list is locked, it could overwrite inode numbers already in the free list while another process was populating it from disk. Again, the race conditions described above would be more frequent. Although the kernel handles them satisfactorily, system performance would suffer. Use of the lock on the super block free list prevents such race conditions.
