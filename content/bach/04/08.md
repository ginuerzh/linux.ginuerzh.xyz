The UNIX system supports two other file types: pipes and special files. A pipe, sometimes called a *fifo* (for "first-in-first-out"), differs from a regular file in that its data is transient: Once data is read from a pipe, it cannot be read again. Also, the data is read in the order that it was written to the pipe, and the system allows no deviation from that order. The kernel stores data in a pipe the same way it stores data in an ordinary file, except that it uses only the direct blocks, not the indirect blocks. The next chapter will examine the implementation of pipes.

The last file types in the UNIX system are special files, including block device special files and character device special files. Both types specify devices, and therefore the file inodes do not reference any data. Instead, the inode contains two numbers known as the major and minor device numbers. The major number indicates a device type such as terminal or disk, and the minor number indicates the unit number of the device. Chapter 10 examines special devices in detail.
