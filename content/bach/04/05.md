So far, this chapter has described the structure of a file, assuming that the inode was previously bound to a file and that the disk blocks containing the data were already assigned. The next sections cover how the kernel assigns inodes and disk blocks. To understand those algorithms, let us examine the structure of the super block.

The super block consists of the following fields:

* the size of the file system,
* the number of free blocks in the file system,
* a list of free blocks available on the file system,
* the index of the next free block in the free block list,
* the size of the inode list,
* the number of free inodes in the file system,
* a list of free inodes in the file system,
* the index of the next free inode in the free inode list,
* lock fields for the free block and free inode lists,
* a flag indicating that the super block has been modified.

The remainder of this chapter will explain the use of the arrays, indices and locks. The kernel periodically writes the super block to disk if it had been modified so that it is consistent with the data in the file system.
