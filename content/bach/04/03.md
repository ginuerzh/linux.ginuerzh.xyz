Recall from Chapter 1 that directories are the files that give the file system its hierarchical structure; they play an important role in conversion of a file name to an inode number: A directory is a file whose data is a sequence of entries, each consisting of an inode number and the name of a file contained in the directory. A path name is a null terminated character string divided into separate components by the slash ("/") character. Each component except the last must be the name of a directory, but the last component may be a non-directory file. UNIX System V restricts component names to a maximum of 14 characters; with a 2 byte entry for the inode number, the size of a directory entry is 16 bytes.

**Figure 4.10.** Directory Layout for /etc

Figure 4.10 depicts the layout of the directory "etc". Every directory contains the file names dot and dot-dot ("." and "..") whose inode numbers are those of the directory and its parent directory, respectively. The inode number of "." in "/etc" is located at offset 0 in the file, and its value is 83. The inode number of ".." is located at offset 16, and its value is 2. Directory entries may be empty, indicated by an inode number of 0. For instance, the entry at address 224 in "/etc" is empty, although it once contained an entry for a file named "crash". The program *mkfs* initializes a file system so that "." and ".." of the root directory have the root inode number of the file system.

The kernel stores data for a directory just as it stores data for an ordinary file, using the inode structure and levels of direct and indirect blocks. Processes may read directories in the same way they read regular files, but the kernel reserves exclusive right to write a directory, thus insuring its correct structure. The access permissions of a directory have the following meaning: read permission on a directory allows a process to read a directory; write permission allows a process to create new directory entries or remove old ones (via the *creat*, *mknod*, *link*, and *unlink* system calls), thereby altering the contents of the directory; execute permission allows a process to search the directory for a file name (it is meaningless to execute a directory). Exercise 4.6 explores the difference between reading and searching a directory.
