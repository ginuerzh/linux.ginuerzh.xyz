A process *closes* an *open* file when it no longer wants to access it. The syntax for the *close* system call is

```c
close(fd);
```

where *fd* is the file descriptor for the *open* file. The kernel does the *close* operation by manipulating the file descriptor and the corresponding file table and inode table entries. If the reference count of the file table entry is greater than 1 because of *dup* or *fork* calls, then other user file descriptors reference the file table entry, as will be seen; the kernel decrements the count and the *close* completes. If the file table reference count is 1, the kernel frees the entry and releases the in-core inode originally allocated in the *open* system call (algorithm *iput*). If other processes still reference the inode, the kernel decrements the inode reference count but leaves it allocated; otherwise, the inode is free for reallocation because its reference count is 0. When the *close* system call completes, the user file descriptor table entry is empty. Attempts by the process to use that file descriptor result in an error until the file descriptor is reassigned as a result of another system call. When a process *exits*, the kernel examines its active user file descriptors and internally *closes* each one. Hence, no process can keep a file open after it terminates.

**Figure 5.11.** Tables after Closing a File

For example, Figure 5.11 shows the relevant table entries of Figure 5.4, after the second process *closes* its files. The entries for file descriptors 3 and 4 in the user file descriptor table are empty. The count fields of the file table entries are now 0, and the entries are empty. The inode reference count for the files, "/etc/passwd" and "private" are also decremented. The inode entry for "private" is on the free list because its reference count is 0, but its entry is not empty. If another process accesses the file "private" while the inode is still on the free list, the kernel will reclaim the inode, as explained in Section 4.1.2.
