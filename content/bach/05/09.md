When the system is first booted, process 0 makes the file system root its current
directory during initialization. It executes the algorithm iget on the root inode,
saves it in the u area as its current directory, and releases the inode lock. When a
new process is created via the fork system call, the new process inherits the current
directory of the old process in its u area, and the kernel increments the inode
reference count accordingly.
