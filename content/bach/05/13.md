The *dup* system call copies a file descriptor into the first free slot of the user file descriptor table, returning the new file descriptor to the user. It works for all file types. The syntax of the system call is

```c
newfd = dup(fd);
```

where *fd* is the file descriptor being *duped* and *newfd* is the new file descriptor that references the file. Because *dup* duplicates the file descriptor, it increments the count of the corresponding file table entry, which now has one more file descriptor entry that points to it, For example, examination of the data structures depicted in Figure 5.20 indicates that the process did the following sequence of system calls: It opened the file "/etc/passwd" (file descriptor 3), then opened the file "local" (file descriptor 4), *opened* the file "/etc/passwd" again (file descriptor 5), and finally, *duped* file descriptor 3, returning file descriptor 6.

*Dup* is perhaps an inelegant system call, because it assumes that the user knows that the system will return the lowest-numbered free entry in the user file descriptor table. However, it serves an important purpose in building sophisticated programs from simpler, building-block programs, as exemplified in the construction of shell pipelines (Chapter 7).

Consider the program in Figure 5.21. The variable *i* contains the file descriptor that the system returns as a result of opening the file "etc/passwd," and the variable *j* contains the file descriptor that the system returns as a result of *duping* the file descriptor *i*. In the *u area* of the process, the two user file descriptor entries represented by the user variables *i* and *j* point to one file table entry and therefore use the same file offset. The first two *reads* in the process thus read the data in sequence, and the two buffers, *buf1* and *buf2*, do not contain the same data.

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
main()
{
    int i, j;
    char buf1[512], buf2[512];

    i = open ("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);
    j = dup(i);
    read(i, buf1, sizeof(buf1));
    read(j, buf2, sizeof(buf2));
    close(i);
    read(j, buf2, sizeof(buf2));
}
```

This differs from the case where a process *opens* the same file twice and *reads* the same data twice (Section 5.2). A process can *close* either file descriptor if it wants, but I/O continues normally on the other file descriptor, as illustrated in the example. In particular, a process can *close* its standard output file descriptor (file descriptor 1), *dup* another file descriptor so that it becomes file descriptor 1, then treat the file as its standard output. Chapter 7 presents a more realistic example of the use of *pipe* and *dup* when it describes the implementation of the shell.
