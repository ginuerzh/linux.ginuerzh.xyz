Changing the owner or mode (access permissions) of a file are operations on the inode, not on the file per se. The syntax of the calls is

```c
chown(pathname, owner, group)
chmod(pathname, mode)
```

To change the owner of a file, the kernel converts the file name to an inode using algorithm *namei*. The process owner must be superuser or match that of the file owner (a process cannot give away something that does not belong to it). The kernel then assigns the new owner and group to the file, clears the set user and set group flags (see Section 7.5), and releases the inode via algorithm *iput*. After the change of ownership, the old owner loses "owner" access rights to the file. To change the mode of a file, the kernel follows a similar procedure, changing the mode flags in the inode instead of the owner numbers.
