This chapter concludes the first part of the book, the explanation of the file system. It introduced three kernel tables: the user file descriptor table, the system file table, and the mount table. It described the algorithms for many system calls relating to the file system and their interaction. It introduced file system abstractions, which allow the UNIX system to support varied file system types. Finally, it described how *fsck* checks the consistency of the file system.
