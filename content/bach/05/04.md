The original UNIX system developed by Thompson and Ritchie did not have an internal mechanism by which a process could insure exclusive access to a file. A locking mechanism was considered unnecessary because, as Ritchie notes, "we are not faced with large, single-file databases maintained by independent processes" (see [Ritchie 81]). To make the UNIX system more attractive to commercial users with database applications, System V now contains file and record locking mechanisms. File locking is the capability to prevent other processes from reading or writing any part of an entire file, and record locking is the capability to prevent other processes from reading or writing particular records (parts of a file between particular byte offsets). Exercise 5.9 explores the implementation of file and record locking.
