Weinberger introduced *file system types* to support his network file system (see [Killian 84] for a brief description of this mechanism), and the latest release of System V supports a derivation of his scheme. File system types allow the kernel to support multiple file systems simultaneously, such as network file systems (Chapter 13) or even file systems of other operating systems. Processes use the usual UNIX system calls to access files, and the kernel maps a generic set of file operations into operations specific to each file system type.

The inode is the interface between the abstract file system and the specific file system. A generic in-core inode contains data that is independent of particular file systems, and points to a file-system-specific inode that contains file-system-specific data. The file-system-specific inode contains information such as access permissions and block layout, but the generic inode contains the device number, inode number, file type, size, owner, and reference count. Other data that is file-system-specific includes the super block and directory structures. Figure 5.34 depicts the generic in-core inode table and two tables of file-system-specific inodes, one for System V file system structures and the other for a remote (network) inode. The latter inode presumably contains enough information to, identify a file on a remote system. A file system may not have an inode-like structure; but the file-system-specific code manufactures an object that satisfies UNIX file system semantics and allocates its "inode" when the kernel allocates a generic inode.

**Figure 5.34.** Inodes for File System Types

Each file system type has a structure that contains the addresses of functions that perform abstract operations. When the kernel wants to access a file, it makes an indirect function call, based on the file system type and the operation (see Figure 5.34). Some abstract operations are to open a file, close it, read or write data, return an inode for a file name component (like *namei* and *iget*), release an inode (like *iput*), update an inode, check access permissions, set file attributes (permissions), and mount and unmount file systems. Chapter 13 will illustrate the use of file system abstractions in the description of a distributed file system.
