The system calls *stat* and *fstat* allow processes to query the status of files, returning information such as the file type, file owner, access permissions, file size, number of links, inode number, and file access times. The syntax for the system calls is

```c
stat(pathname, statbuffer);
fstat(fd, statbuffer);
```

where *pathname* is a file name, *fd* is a file descriptor returned by a previous *open* call, and *statbuffer* is the address of a data structure in the user process that will contain the status information of the file on completion of the call. The system calls simply write the fields of the inode into *statbuffer*. The program in Figure 5.33 will illustrate the use of *stat* and *fstat*.
