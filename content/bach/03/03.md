As seen in Figure 2.1, high-level kernel algorithms in the file subsystem invoke the algorithms for managing the buffer cache. The high-level algorithms determine the logical device number and block number that they Wish to access when they attempt to retrieve a block. For example, if a process wants to read data from a file, the kernel determines which file system contains the file and which block in the file system contains the data, as will be seen in Chapter 4. When about to read data from a particular disk block, the kernel checks whether the block is in the buffer pool and, if it is not there, assigns it a free buffer. When about to write data to a particular disk block, the kernel checks whether the block is in the buffer pool, and if not, assigns a free buffer for that block. The algorithms for reading and writing disk blocks use the algorithm *getblk* (Figure 3.4) to allocate buffers from the pool.

This section describes five typical scenarios the kernel may follow in *getblk* to allocate a buffer for a disk block.

1. The kernel finds the block on its hash queue, and its buffer is free.
2. The kernel cannot find the block on the hash queue, so it allocates a buffer from the free list.
3. The kernel cannot find the block on the hash queue and, in attempting to allocate a buffer from the free list (as in scenario 2), finds a buffer on the free list that has been marked "delayed write." The kernel must write the "delayed write" buffer to disk and allocate another buffer.
4. The kernel cannot find the block on the hash queue, and the free list of buffers is empty.
5. The kernel finds the block on the hash queue, but its buffer is currently busy.

Let us now discuss each scenario in greater detail.

When searching for a block in the buffer pool by its device-block number combination, the kernel finds the hash queue that should contain the block. It searches the hash queue, following the linked list of buffers until (in the first scenario) it finds the buffer whose device and block number match those for which it is searching. The kernel checks that the buffer is free and, if so, marks the buffer "busy" so that other processes<sup>2</sup> cannot access it. The kernel then removes the buffer from the free list, because a buffer cannot be both busy and on the free list. If other processes attempt to access the block while the buffer is busy, they sleep until the buffer is released, as will be seen. Figure 3.5 depicts the first scenario, where the kernel searches for block 4 on the hash queue marked "blkno 0 mod 4." Finding the buffer, the kernel removes it from the free list, leaving blocks 5 and 28 adjacent on the free list.

        {
            if (buffer busy)    /* scenario 5 */
            {
                sleep (event buffer becomes free);
                continue; /* back to while loop */
            }
            mark buffer busy; /* scenario 1 */
            remove buffer from free list;
            return buffer;
        }
        else /* block not on hash queue */
        {
            if (there are no buffers on free list) /* scenario 4 */
            {
                sleep (event any buffer becomes free);
                continue; /* back to while loop */
            }
            remove buffer from free list;
            if (buffer marked for delayed write) { /* scenario 3 */
                asynchronous write buffer to disk;
                continue; /* back to while loop */
            }
            /* scenario 2 -- found a free buffer */
            remove buffer from old hash queue;
            put buffer onto new hash queue;
            return buffer;
        }
    }
}
```

{
    wakeup all procs: event, waiting for any buffer to become free;
    wakeup all procs: event, waiting for this buffer to become free;
    raise processor execution level to block interrupts;
    if (buffer contents valid and buffer not old)
        enqueue buffer at end of free list
    else
        enqueue buffer at beginning of free list
    lower processor execution level to allow interrupts;
    unlock(buffer);
}
```

**Figure 3.6.** Algorithm for Releasing a Buffer

Before continuing to the other scenarios, let us consider what happens to a buffer after it is allocated. The kernel may read data from the disk to the buffer and manipulate it or write data to the buffer and possibly to the disk. The kernel leaves the buffer marked busy; no other process can access it and change its contents while it is busy, thus preserving the integrity of the data in the buffer. When the kernel finishes using the buffer, it releases the buffer according to algorithm *brelse* (Figure 3.6). It wakes up processes that had fallen asleep because the buffer was busy and processes that had fallen asleep because no buffers remained on the free list. In both cases, release of a buffer means that the buffer is available for use by the sleeping processes, although the first process that gets the buffer locks it and prevents the other processes from getting it (recall Section 2.2.2.4). The kernel places the buffer at the end of the free list, unless an I/O error occurred or unless it specifically marked the buffer "old," as will be seen later in this chapter; in the latter cases, it places the buffer at the beginning of the free list. The buffer is now free for another process to claim it.

2\. Recall from the last chapter that all kernel operations are done in the context of a process that is executing in kernel mode. Thus, the term "other processes" means that they are also executing in kernel mode. This term will be used when describing the interaction of several processes executing in kernel mode; if there is no interprocess interaction, the term "kernel" will be used.
