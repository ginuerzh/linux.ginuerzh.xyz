As seen in Figure 2.1, high-level kernel algorithms in the file subsystem invoke the algorithms for managing the buffer cache. The high-level algorithms determine the logical device number and block number that they Wish to access when they attempt to retrieve a block. For example, if a process wants to read data from a file, the kernel determines which file system contains the file and which block in the file system contains the data, as will be seen in Chapter 4. When about to read data from a particular disk block, the kernel checks whether the block is in the buffer pool and, if it is not there, assigns it a free buffer. When about to write data to a particular disk block, the kernel checks whether the block is in the buffer pool, and if not, assigns a free buffer for that block. The algorithms for reading and writing disk blocks use the algorithm *getblk* (Figure 3.4) to allocate buffers from the pool.

This section describes five typical scenarios the kernel may follow in *getblk* to allocate a buffer for a disk block.

1. The kernel finds the block on its hash queue, and its buffer is free.
2. The kernel cannot find the block on the hash queue, so it allocates a buffer from the free list.
3. The kernel cannot find the block on the hash queue and, in attempting to allocate a buffer from the free list (as in scenario 2), finds a buffer on the free list that has been marked "delayed write." The kernel must write the "delayed write" buffer to disk and allocate another buffer.
4. The kernel cannot find the block on the hash queue, and the free list of buffers is empty.
5. The kernel finds the block on the hash queue, but its buffer is currently busy.

Let us now discuss each scenario in greater detail.

When searching for a block in the buffer pool by its device-block number combination, the kernel finds the hash queue that should contain the block. It searches the hash queue, following the linked list of buffers until (in the first scenario) it finds the buffer whose device and block number match those for which it is searching. The kernel checks that the buffer is free and, if so, marks the buffer "busy" so that other processes<sup>2</sup> cannot access it. The kernel then removes the buffer from the free list, because a buffer cannot be both busy and on the free list. If other processes attempt to access the block while the buffer is busy, they sleep until the buffer is released, as will be seen. Figure 3.5 depicts the first scenario, where the kernel searches for block 4 on the hash queue marked "blkno 0 mod 4." Finding the buffer, the kernel removes it from the free list, leaving blocks 5 and 28 adjacent on the free list.

            {
                sleep (event buffer becomes free);
                continue; /* back to while loop */
            }
            mark buffer busy; /* scenario 1 */
            remove buffer from free list;
            return buffer;
        }
        else /* block not on hash queue */
        {
            if (there are no buffers on free list) /* scenario 4 */
            {
                sleep (event any buffer becomes free);
                continue; /* back to while loop */
            }
            remove buffer from free list;

            }

            remove buffer from old hash queue;
            put buffer onto new hash queue;
            return buffer;
        }
    }
}

    unlock(buffer);
}
```

**Figure 3.6.** Algorithm for Releasing a Buffer

Before continuing to the other scenarios, let us consider what happens to a buffer after it is allocated. The kernel may read data from the disk to the buffer and manipulate it or write data to the buffer and possibly to the disk. The kernel leaves the buffer marked busy; no other process can access it and change its contents while it is busy, thus preserving the integrity of the data in the buffer. When the kernel finishes using the buffer, it releases the buffer according to algorithm *brelse* (Figure 3.6). It wakes up processes that had fallen asleep because the buffer was busy and processes that had fallen asleep because no buffers remained on the free list. In both cases, release of a buffer means that the buffer is available for use by the sleeping processes, although the first process that gets the buffer locks it and prevents the other processes from getting it (recall Section 2.2.2.4). The kernel places the buffer at the end of the free list, unless an I/O error occurred or unless it specifically marked the buffer "old," as will be seen later in this chapter; in the latter cases, it places the buffer at the beginning of the free list. The buffer is now free for another process to claim it.

Just as the kernel invokes algorithm *brelse* when a process has no more need for a buffer, it also invokes the algorithm when handling a disk interrupt to release buffers used for asynchronous I/O to and from the disk, as will be seen in Section 3.4. The kernel raises the processor execution level to prevent disk interrupts while manipulating the free list, thereby preventing corruption of the buffer pointers that could result from a nested call to *brelse*. Similar bad effects could happen if an interrupt handler invoked *brelse* while a process was executing *getblk*, so the kernel raises the processor execution level at strategic places in *getblk*, too. The exercises explore these cases in greater detail.

In the second scenario in algorithm *getblk*, the kernel searches the hash queue that should contain the block but fails to find it there. Since the block cannot be on another hash queue because it cannot "hash" elsewhere, it is not in the buffer cache. So the kernel removes the first buffer from the free list instead; that buffer had been allocated to another disk block and is also on a hash queue. If the buffer has not been marked for a delayed write (as will be described later), the kernel marks the buffer busy, removes it from the hash queue where it currently resides, reassigns the buffer header's device and block number to that of the disk block for which the process is searching, and places the buffer on the correct hash queue. The kernel uses the buffer but has no record that the buffer formerly contained data for another disk block. A process searching for the old disk block will not find it in the pool and will have to allocate a new buffer for it from the free list, exactly as outlined here. When the kernel finishes with the buffer, it releases it as described above. In Figure 3.7, for example, the kernel searches for block 18 but does not find it on the hash queue marked "blkno 2 mod 4." It therefore removes
the first buffer from the free list (block 3), assigns it to block 18, and places it on the appropriate hash queue.

(b) Remove First Block from Free List, Assign to 18

**Figure 3.7.** Second Scenario for Buffer Allocation

In the third scenario in algorithm *getblk*, the kernel also has to allocate a buffer from the free list. However, it discovers that the buffer it removes from the free list has been marked for "delayed write," so it must write the contents of the buffer to disk before using the buffer. The kernel starts an asynchronous write to disk and tries to allocate another buffer from the free list. When the asynchronous write completes, the kernel releases the buffer and places it at the head of the free list. The buffer had started at the end of the free list and had traveled to the head of the free list. If, after the asynchronous write, the kernel were to place the buffer at the end of the free list, the buffer would get a free trip through the free list, working against the least recently used algorithm.

(b) Writing Blocks 3, 5, Reassign 4 to 18

**Figure 3.8.** Third Scenario for Buffer Allocation

For example, in Figure 3.8, the kernel cannot find block 18, but when it attempts to allocate the first two buffers (one at a time) on the free list, it finds them marked for delayed write. The kernel removes them from the free list, starts write operations to disk for the blocks, and allocates the third buffer on the free list, block 4. It reassigns the buffer's device and block number fields appropriately and places the buffer, now marked block 18, on its new bash queue.

Search for Block 18, Empty Free List

**Figure 3.9.** Fourth Scenario for Allocating Buffer

In the fourth scenario (Figure 3.9), the kernel, acting for process A, cannot find the disk block on its hash queue, so it attempts to allocate a new buffer from the free list, as in the second scenario. However, no buffers are available on the free list, so process A goes to sleep until another process executes algorithm *brelse*, freeing a buffer. When the kernel schedules process A, it must search the hash queue again for the block. It cannot allocate a buffer immediately from the free list, because it is possible that several processes were waiting for a free buffer and that one of them allocated a newly freed buffer for the target block sought by process A. Thus, searching for the block again insures that only one buffer contains the disk block. Figure 3.10 depicts the contention between two processes for a free buffer.

![figure 3.10](/linux/img/bach/figure3.10.jpg)

**Figure 3.10.** Race for Free Buffer

The final scenario (Figure 3.11) is complicated, because it involves complex relationships between several processes. Suppose the kernel, acting for process A, searches for a disk block and allocates a buffer but goes to sleep before freeing the buffer. For example, if process A attempts to read a disk block and allocates a buffer as in scenario 2, then it will sleep while it waits for the I/O transmission
from disk, to complete. While process A sleeps, suppose the kernel schedules a second process, B, which tries to access the disk block whose buffer was just locked by process A. Process B (going through scenario 5) will find the locked block on the hash queue. Since it is illegal to use a locked buffer and it is illegal to allocate a second buffer for a disk block, process B marks the buffer "in demand" and then sleeps and waits for process A to release the buffer.

![figure 3.11](/linux/img/bach/figure3.11.jpg)

Search for Block 99, Block Busy

**Figure 3.11.** Fifth Scenario for Buffer Allocation

Process A will eventually release the buffer and notice that the buffer is in demand. It awakens all processes sleeping on the event "the buffer becomes free," including process B. When the kernel again schedules process B, process B must verify that the buffer is free. Another process, C, may have been waiting for the same buffer, and the kernel may have scheduled C to run before process B; process C may have gone to sleep leaving the buffer locked. Hence, process B must check that the block is indeed free.

Process B must also verify that the buffer contains the disk block that it originally requested, because process C may have allocated the buffer to another block, as in scenario 2. When process B executes, it may find that it had been waiting for the wrong buffer, so it must search for the block again: If it were to allocate a buffer automatically from the free list, it would miss the possibility that another process just allocated a buffer for the block.

In the end, process B will find its block, possibly allocating a new buffer from the free list as in the second scenario. In Figure 3.11, for example, a process searching for block 99 finds it on its hash queue, but the block is marked busy. The process sleeps until the block becomes free and then restarts the algorithm from the beginning. Figure 3.12 depicts the contention for a locked buffer.

![figure 3.12](/linux/img/bach/figure3.12.jpg)

**Figure 3.12.** Race for a Locked Buffer

The algorithm for buffer allocation must be safe; processes must not sleep forever, and they must eventually get a buffer. The kernel guarantees that all processes waiting for buffers will wake up, because it allocates. buffers during the execution of system calls and frees them before returning.<sup>3</sup> Processes in user mode do not control the allocation of kernel buffers directly, so they cannot purposely "hog" buffers. The kernel loses control over a buffer only when it waits for the completion of I/O between the buffer and the disk. It is conceivable that a disk drive is corrupt so that it cannot interrupt the CPU, preventing the kernel from ever releasing the buffer. The disk driver must monitor the hardware for such cases and return an error to the kernel for a bad disk job. In short, the kernel can guarantee that processes sleeping for a buffer will wake up eventually.

It is also possible to imagine cases where a process is starved out of accessing a buffer. In the fourth scenario, for example, if several processes sleep while waiting for a buffer to become free, the kernel does not guarantee that they get a buffer in the order that they requested one. A process could sleep and wake up when a buffer becomes free, only to go to sleep again because another process got control of the buffer first. Theoretically, this could go on forever, but practically, it is not a problem because of the many buffer& that are typically configured in the system.

2\. Recall from the last chapter that all kernel operations are done in the context of a process that is executing in kernel mode. Thus, the term "other processes" means that they are also executing in kernel mode. This term will be used when describing the interaction of several processes executing in kernel mode; if there is no interprocess interaction, the term "kernel" will be used.

3\. The *mount* system call is an exception; because it allocates a buffer until a later *umount* call. This exception is not critical, because the total number of buffers far exceeds the number of active mounted file systems.
