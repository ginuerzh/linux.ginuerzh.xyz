During system initialization, the kernel allocates space for a number of buffers, configurable according to memory size and system performance constraints. A buffer consists of two parts: a memory array that contains data from the disk and a *buffer header* that identifies the buffer. Because there is a one to one mapping of buffer headers to data arrays, the ensuing text will frequently refer to both parts as a "buffer," and the context should make clear which part is being discussed.

The data in a buffer corresponds to the data in a logical disk block on a file system, and the kernel identifies the buffer contents by examining identifier fields in the buffer header. The buffer is the in-memory copy of the disk block; the contents of the disk block map into the buffer, but the mapping is temporary until the kernel decides to map another disk block into the buffer. A disk block can never map into more than one buffer at a time. If two buffers were to contain data for one disk block, the kernel would not know which buffer contained the current data and could write incorrect data back to disk. For example, suppose a disk block maps into two buffers, A and B. If the kernel writes data first into buffer A and then into buffer B, the disk block should contain the contents of buffer B if all write operations completely fill the buffer. However, if the kernel reverses the order when it copies the buffers to disk, the disk block will contain incorrect data.

**Figure 3.1.** Buffer Header

The buffer header (Figure 3.1) contains a *device number* field and a *block number* field that specify the file system and block number of the data on disk and uniquely identify the buffer. The device number is the logical file system number (see Section 2.2.1), not a physical device (disk) unit number. The buffer header also contains a pointer to a data array for the buffer, whose size must be at least as big as the size of a disk block, and a status field that summarizes the current status of the buffer. The status of a buffer is a combination of the following conditions:

* The buffer is currently locked (the terms "locked" and "busy" will be used interchangeably, as will "free" and "unlocked"),
* The buffer contains valid data,
* The kernel must write the buffer contents to disk before reassigning the buffer; this condition is known as "delayed-write,"
* The kernel is currently reading or writing the contents of the buffer to disk,
* A process is currently waiting for the buffer to become free.

The buffer header also contains two sets of pointers, used by the buffer allocation algorithms to maintain the overall structure of the buffer pool, as explained in the next section.
