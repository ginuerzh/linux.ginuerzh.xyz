The kernel caches data in the buffer pool according to a *least recently used* algorithm: after it allocates a buffer to a disk block, it cannot use the buffer for another block until all other buffers have been used more recently. The kernel maintains a *free list* of buffers that preserves the least recently used order. The free list is a doubly linked circular list of buffers with a dummy buffer header that marks its beginning and end (Figure 3.2).

**Figure 3.2.** Free List of Buffers

Every buffer is put on the free list when the system is booted. The kernel takes a buffer from the head of the free list when it wants *any* free buffer, but it can take a buffer from the middle of the free list if it identifies a particular block in the buffer pool. In both cases, it removes the buffer from the free list. When the kernel returns a buffer to the buffer pool, it usually attaches the buffer to the tail of the free list, occasionally to the head of the free list (for error cases), but never to the middle. As the kernel removes buffers from the free list, a buffer with valid data moves closer and closer to head of the free list (Figure 3.2). Hence, the buffers that are closer to the head of the free list have not been used as recently as those that are further from the head of the free list.

When the kernel accesses a disk block, it searches for a buffer with the appropriate device-block number combination. Rather than search the entire buffer pool, it organizes the buffers into separate queues, *hashed* as a function of the device and block number. The kernel links the buffers on a hash queue into a
circular, doubly linked list, similar to the structure of the free list. The number of buffers on a hash queue varies during the lifetime of the system, as will be seen. The kernel must use a hashing function that distributes the buffers uniformly across the set of hash queues, yet the hash function must be simple so that performance does not suffer. System administrators configure the number of hash queues when generating the operating system.

**Figure 3.3.** Buffers on the Hash Queues

Figure 3.3 shows buffers on their hash queues: the headers of the hash queues are on the left side of the figure, and the squares on each row are buffers on a hash queue. Thus, squares marked 28, 4, and 64 represent buffers on the hash queue for "blkno 0 mod 4" (block number 0 modulo 4). The dotted lines between the buffers represent the forward and back pointers for the hash queue; for simplicity, later
figures in this chapter will not show these pointers, but their existence is implicit. Similarly, the figure identifies blocks only by their block number, and it uses a hash function dependent only on a block number; however, implementations use the device number, too.

Each buffer always exists on a hash queue, but there is no significance to its position on the queue. As stated above, no two buffers may simultaneously contain the contents of the same disk block; therefore, every disk block in the buffer pool exists on one and only one hash queue and only once on that queue. However, a buffer may be on the free list as well if its status is free. Because a buffer may be simultaneously on a hash queue and on the free list, the kernel has two ways to find it: It searches the hash queue if it is looking for a particular buffer, and it removes a buffer from the free list if it is looking for any free buffer. The next section will show how the kernel finds particular disk blocks in the buffer cache, and how it manipulates buffers on the hash queues and on the free list. To summarize, a
buffer is always on a hash queue, but it may or may not be on the free list.
