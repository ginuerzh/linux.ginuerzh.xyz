Most kernel data structures occupy fixed-size tables rather than dynamically allocated space, The advantage of this approach is that the kernel code is simple, but it limits the number of entries for a data structure to the number that was originally configured when generating the system: If, during operation of the system, the kernel should run out of entries for a data structure, it cannot allocate space for new entries dynamically but must report an ô€—†nor to the requesting user. If, on the other hand, the kernel is configured so that it it is unlikely to run out of table space, the extra table space may be wasted because it cannot be used for other purposes. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the kernel algorithms has generally been considered more important than the need to squeeze out every last byte of
main memory. Algorithms typically use simple loops to find free table entries, a method that is easier to understand and sometimes more efficient than more complicated allocation schemes.
