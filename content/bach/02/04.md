Administrative processes are loosely classified as those processes that do various functions for the general welfare of the user community. Such functions include disk formatting. creation of new file systems, repair of damaged file systems, kernel debugging, and others. Conceptually, there is no difference between administrative processes and user processes: They use the same set of system calls available to the general community. They are distinguished from general user processes only in the rights and privileges they are allowed. For example, file permission modes may allow administrative processes to manipulate files otherwise off-limits to general users. Internally, the kernel distinguishes a special user called the *superuser*, endowing it with special privileges, as will be seen. A user may become a superuser by going through a login-password sequence or by executing special programs. Other uses of superuser privileges will be studied in later chapters. In short, the kernel does not recognize a separate class of administrative processes.
