1\. Consider the following sequence of commands:

```bash
grep main a.c b.c c.c > grepout &
wc -l < grepout &
rm grepout &
```

The ampersand ("&") at the end of each command line informs the shell to run the command in the background, and it can execute each command line in Parallel. Why is this not equivalent to the following command line?

```bash
grep main a.c b.c c.c | wc -l
```

2\. Consider the sample kernel code in Figure 2.7. Suppose a context switch happens when the code reaches the comment, and suppose another process removes a buffer from the linked list by executing the following code:

```c
remove(qp)
    struct queue *qp;
{
    qp->forp->backp = qp->backp;
    qp->backp->forp = qp->forp;
    qp->forp = qp->backp = NULL;
}
```

Consider three cases:

- The process removes the structure *bpl* from the linked list.
- The process removes the structure that currently follows *bpl* on the linked list.
- The process removes the structure that originally followed *bpl* before *bp* was half placed on the linked list.

What is the status of the linked list after the original process completes executing the code after the comment?

3\. What should happen if the kernel attempts to awaken all processes sleeping on an event, but no processes are asleep on the event at the time of the wakeup?
